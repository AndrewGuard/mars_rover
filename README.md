This is my solution to a mars rover challenge. It requires Java 7 to run properly.

The code assumes that the imput in the .txt file will be valid and not send the rover beyond the paramaters of the plateau. Currently, the Plateau class is not being utilized - it simply returns the dimensions of the plateau to be used later if necessary. The code also assumes that no two rovers will crash into each other.

In order to run the program, compile the program with javac *.java from the directory in which it is stored and then call Java MarsRover (.txt file name). Currrently, the command is "java MarsRover mars_rover_input.txt".
